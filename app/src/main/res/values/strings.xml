    <string name="about_section1">Trust can be seen as a small logging tool, maybe as your phones diary. \nIt will keep a log of things that happened on your device. Whether it has been incoming calls, changed apps or your screen has been turned on or unlocked.\nYou can use it if you suspect that apps have been installed that you don\'t know of or if you left your phone on the table and fear someone used it without consent.</string>
    <string name="about_section2">The difference between the free and the pro version is the amount of shown past events.\nWhile the free version shows the events of the last day, the Pro version will show all available events.\nIt won\'t be able to retroactively display events that happened before it was installed.</string>
